### 3. Overview

The process includes identification, justification, validation, approval, documentation, and ongoing monitoring of accepted risks to maintain visibility and control over the organization's risk posture.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **1** | **Risk Owner** | Identify a risk that cannot be feasibly mitigated or where mitigation costs exceed business impact, and propose it for formal acceptance. |
| **2** | **Risk Owner** | Complete a formal "Risk Acceptance Form" detailing the risk description, business justification for acceptance, potential impact assessment, likelihood evaluation, and proposed duration of acceptance. |
| **3** | **[Security Department/Team Name]** | Review the completed Risk Acceptance Form to validate the accuracy of the risk assessment, verify potential impacts have been fully considered, and assess alignment with organizational risk tolerance. |

| **5** | **CISO/Committee Chair** | Provide formal, written approval or rejection of the risk acceptance request. All approvals must include electronic or physical signature and specify acceptance duration and conditions. |
| **6** | **Risk Owner** | Update the company's central Risk Register with the approved risk acceptance, including acceptance status, justification summary, approval authority, effective dates, and scheduled review dates. |
| **7** | **Risk Owner** | Establish ongoing monitoring procedures to track the accepted risk for any changes in likelihood, impact, or business context that might affect the acceptance decision. |
