# High-Resilience ISMS for Live Streaming Platforms

This repository contains a comprehensive set of template policies and procedures for building an Information Security Management System (ISMS). These documents have been specifically designed and tailored for high-growth, cloud-native live streaming companies operating in the creator economy.

## About This Project

High-growth streaming platforms face a complex web of international regulations and unique operational risks. A generic ISMS is insufficient. This project provides a robust, auditable, and adaptable framework that addresses the specific challenges of ensuring security, privacy, and trust while moving at the speed of a venture-backed startup.

The policies and procedures in this ISMS are written to align with the requirements of the following major compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2** (Trust Services Criteria)
- **PCI DSS v4.0** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**
- **PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Canada)
- **CCPA / CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act / Rights Act)
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
## Who Is This For?

This policy set is ideal for:

- High-growth, venture-backed live streaming platforms.
- Companies with a "creator-first" business model involving monetization and payouts.
- Organizations with cloud-native infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) and high-throughput DevOps teams.
- Platforms operating globally, especially in the US, Europe, and Canada, that need to manage multi-jurisdictional compliance.
## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Compliance:** Addresses a wide range of critical regulations, reducing the burden of starting from scratch.
- **Tailored for the Creator Economy:** Includes policies and controls for specific risks like gamified monetization, large-scale content moderation, and creator payout systems.
- **Availability-Focused:** The Business Continuity and Incident Response policies are written to support near-zero downtime for core live streaming services, recognizing that availability is a primary business driver.
- **Cloud-Native & DevOps Ready:** Incorporates modern security controls for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring security enables, rather than hinders, rapid development.
- **Professional, Auditable Format:** Policies are written using a hybrid style for maximum clarity. Contextual sections (`Objective`, `Scope`) are in readable prose, while core control sections use full declarative sentences, making each requirement a distinct, auditable item.
## How to Use These Templates

**IMPORTANT:** These documents are **templates**, not a complete, out-of-the-box compliance solution. You must adapt them to fit your organization's specific technologies, processes, and risk tolerance.

1. **Clone or Fork this Repository:** Get a local copy to begin customizing.
2. **Find and Replace Placeholders:** Search for bracketed placeholders and replace them with your company's specific information. Common placeholders include:
    - `[Company Name]`
    - `[Role Title]` (e.g., CISO, DPO)
    - `[System Name]` (e.g., the name of your EDR solution or cloud provider)
    - `[Number, e.g., 90]` (for specific timeframes like password rotation)
3. **Review and Customize:** Read every policy and procedure carefully. Modify, add, or remove sections to accurately reflect how your organization operates. Pay close attention to the hybrid writing style:
    - For **short lists of controls (4 or fewer)**, use a prose paragraph format.
    - For **longer lists of controls (5 or more)**, use the full declarative sentence format for each bullet point to ensure auditability.
4. **Seek Expert Review:** Before finalizing and adopting these policies, you **must** have them reviewed by qualified legal counsel and a compliance professional to ensure they meet all of your specific legal and regulatory obligations.
5. **Formal Adoption:** Once approved, formally adopt the policies through your internal governance process. Ensure they are communicated to all workforce members and that training is provided.
