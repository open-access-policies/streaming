# Streaming Tech ISMS Policy and Procedure Templates
This repository contains a set of template policies and procedures for building an Information Security Management System (ISMS). These documents are specifically designed to provide a starting point for streaming tech companies, startups, and other organizations that need to comply with various privacy regulations.
## About This Project
There is a laundry list of frameworks and control regimes out there such as GDPR, DSA, PIPEDA, CCPA, etc. This project aims to provide a comprehensive set of templates that cover common requirements for a streaming platform operating in the US, Europe, and Canada. The templates are designed to be flexible and adaptable to your organization's specific needs.
## Who Is This For?
This policy set is ideal for streaming platforms who operate in the US, Europe, and Canada.

## How to Use These Templates
**IMPORTANT:** These documents are **templates**, not a complete, out-of-the-box compliance solution. You must adapt them to fit your organization's specific technologies, processes, and risk tolerance.

1. **Clone or Fork this Repository:** Get a local copy to begin customizing.
2. **Find and Replace Placeholders:** Search for bracketed placeholders and replace them with your company's specific information. Common placeholders include:
    - `[Company Name]`
    - `[Role Title]` (e.g., Security Officer, IT Manager)
    - `[System Name]` (e.g., the name of your EDR solution or cloud provider)  
    - `[Number, e.g., 90]` (for specific timeframes like password rotation)
3. **Review and Customize:** Read every policy and procedure carefully. Modify, add, or remove sections to accurately reflect how your organization operates.
4. **Seek Expert Review:** Before finalizing and adopting these policies, you **must** have them reviewed by qualified legal counsel and a compliance professional to ensure they meet all of your specific legal and regulatory obligations.
5. **Formal Adoption:** Once approved, formally adopt the policies through your internal governance process. Ensure they are communicated to all workforce members and that training is provided.
