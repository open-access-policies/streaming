parent: Privacy Procedures
order: 4
---

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to establish a systematic process for conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as required under GDPR Article 35 for high-risk data processing activities, particularly those involving large-scale use of new technologies such as recommendation algorithms, AI systems, and automated decision-making tools used in the video streaming platform.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all new features, system changes, and processing activities that are likely to result in high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, including but not limited to: large-scale processing using new technologies, systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas, processing of sensitive personal data, automated decision-making with legal or significant effects, innovative use of AI and machine learning algorithms, and changes to recommendation systems that process user behavior data.

### 3. Overview

This procedure ensures systematic assessment of privacy risks through structured DPIA methodology, mandatory consultation with the [Senior Privacy Role, e.g., DPO], thorough evaluation of necessity and proportionality of data processing, comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation planning, and detailed documentation of outcomes to demonstrate GDPR compliance and protect data subject rights.

### 9. Definitions

**Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):** A process designed to describe the processing, assess its necessity and proportionality, and help manage the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons resulting from the processing of personal data.

**High-Risk Processing:** Processing activities likely to result in high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, particularly involving new technologies, large-scale processing, or vulnerable populations.

**Necessity and Proportionality:** Assessment of whether data processing is necessary to achieve specified purposes and proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, considering less intrusive alternatives.

**Automated Decision-Making:** Processing that involves making decisions about individuals solely through automated means without human intervention.

**Large-Scale Processing:** Processing involving substantial amounts of personal data at regional, national, or supranational level affecting a large number of data subjects.

**Prior Consultation:** Mandatory consultation with supervisory authority when DPIA indicates high risk that cannot be adequately mitigated through other means.
