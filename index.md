## About This Project

High-growth streaming platforms face a complex web of international regulations and unique operational risks. A generic ISMS is insufficient. This project provides a robust, auditable, and adaptable framework that addresses the specific challenges of ensuring security, privacy, and trust while moving at the speed of a venture-backed startup.

The policies and procedures in this ISMS are written to align with the requirements of the following major compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2** (Trust Services Criteria)
- **PCI DSS v4.0** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**
- **PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Canada)
- **CCPA / CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act / Rights Act)
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)

## Getting Started

Each policy category contains both high-level policies that establish requirements and detailed procedures that provide implementation guidance. Policies are numbered for easy reference and cross-linking.

Start by reviewing the policies most relevant to your immediate needs, then work through the related procedures to understand implementation requirements.
