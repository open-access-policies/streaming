### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the systematic approach for conducting security testing of video streaming platform applications to identify vulnerabilities, validate security controls, and ensure applications meet security requirements before deployment to production environments.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all applications supporting the video streaming platform, including web applications, mobile applications, APIs, microservices, and backend systems. It covers security testing activities performed during development, before production deployment, and as part of ongoing security validation.

### 3. Overview

This procedure ensures comprehensive security testing through multiple testing methodologies including static analysis, dynamic testing, and manual security reviews. The process integrates with the software development lifecycle to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **1** | **[Development Department/Team Name]** | Submit application for security testing with documentation including architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and threat model. |
| **2** | **Security Testing Team** | Review application documentation and create security testing plan covering scope, methodology, and success criteria. |
| **3** | **DevSecOps Team** | Configure automated security testing tools (SAST, DAST, SCA) and integrate into CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing. |
| **4** | **Security Testing Team** | Execute static application security testing (SAST) on source code to identify coding vulnerabilities and security flaws. |
| **5** | **Security Testing Team** | Perform software composition analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and open source components. |
| **6** | **Security Testing Team** | Conduct dynamic application security testing (DAST) on running application to identify runtime vulnerabilities and configuration issues. |
| **7** | **Security Testing Team** | Execute API security testing including authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting verification. |
| **8** | **Security Testing Team** | Perform manual security testing for business logic flaws, privilege escalation, and platform-specific security issues. |
| **9** | **Security Testing Team** | Conduct mobile application security testing including binary analysis, runtime analysis, and platform-specific security controls. |
| **10** | **Security Testing Team** | Document all findings with severity ratings, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and detailed remediation recommendations. |
| **11** | **[Development Department/Team Name]** | Review security findings, develop remediation plans, and implement fixes for identified vulnerabilities. |
| **12** | **Security Testing Team** | Verify remediation effectiveness through retesting and validate that fixes do not introduce new security issues. |
| **13** | **Security Testing Team** | Generate comprehensive security testing report with executive summary, findings summary, and approval recommendation. |
| **14** | **Application Security Architect** | Review security testing results and provide approval for production deployment or require additional security measures. |

### 5. Standards Compliance

| **Procedure Step(s)** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **3-4** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.14.2.3 |
| **6-8** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | DE.CM-4 |
| **9** | OWASP Mobile Security | MSTG-CODE |
| **11-12** | SOC 2 Type II | CC8.1 |

### 6. Artifact(s)

A comprehensive security testing report containing executive summary, detailed vulnerability findings with severity ratings and remediation guidance, testing methodology documentation, and formal security approval for production deployment stored in the security testing repository.

### 7. Definitions

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Automated analysis of source code to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the program.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Automated testing of running applications to identify security vulnerabilities through black-box testing.

**Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Analysis of third-party and open source components to identify known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues.

**Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):** Security testing that analyzes code during application runtime using instrumented agents.

**API Security Testing:** Specialized testing focused on application programming interface security including authentication, authorization, and input validation.

**Business Logic Flaw:** Security vulnerability arising from errors in the design or implementation of application business rules.

### 8. Responsibilities

| **Role** | **Responsibility** |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| **Security Testing Team** | Execute comprehensive security testing, document findings accurately, and provide expert remediation guidance to development teams. |
| **[Development Department/Team Name]** | Provide complete application documentation, implement security fixes promptly, and support security testing activities. |
| **DevSecOps Team** | Maintain security testing tools, integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines, and automate security testing processes. |
| **Application Security Architect** | Define security testing requirements, review testing results, and make production deployment approval decisions. |
