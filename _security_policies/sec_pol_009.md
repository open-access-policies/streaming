### 1. Objective

This policy establishes the overarching strategy and requirements for monitoring [Company Name]'s systems, networks, and applications to detect, analyze, and respond to potential security threats in a timely manner. The framework ensures comprehensive visibility into security-relevant events across the video streaming platform and supporting infrastructure, enabling proactive threat detection and rapid incident response to protect our global user base.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all Company-owned and managed systems, networks, applications, and infrastructure components used to deliver video streaming services. Coverage includes monitoring of user-facing applications, content delivery networks, backend services, administrative systems, and third-party integrations that process or access Company or user data across all operational environments.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Security Monitoring Strategy**

The Company shall implement a defense-in-depth monitoring strategy that includes network, system, application, and data-level monitoring to provide comprehensive visibility into security-relevant events. This multi-layered approach ensures detection capabilities across all infrastructure tiers and attack vectors targeting the video streaming platform.

**3.2 Log Management**

All critical infrastructure components, applications, and security systems must generate logs for security-relevant events including authentication attempts, privilege escalations, data access, configuration changes, and network communications. The Company shall implement a centralized log management system to aggregate, normalize, and store log data. Minimum log retention requirements are 90 days for active online storage and 1 year for archived storage to support incident investigation and compliance requirements.

**3.3 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**

The Company shall deploy and maintain a SIEM platform to aggregate, correlate, and analyze log data from disparate sources in real-time to identify potential security incidents. The SIEM must include correlation rules for common attack patterns, integration with threat intelligence feeds, and automated alerting capabilities for high-priority security events affecting the streaming platform.

**3.4 Threat Detection Technologies**

The Company shall implement specialized threat detection technologies including Network Security Monitoring (NSM) for traffic analysis and intrusion detection, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for workstations and servers to monitor system activities and malware, and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for detecting anomalous user activities and potential insider threats.

**3.5 Alerting and Triage**

Security monitoring systems shall generate alerts based on predefined criteria and risk thresholds. Alerts must be prioritized based on severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) considering potential impact to platform availability, user data, and business operations. The Security Operations Center (SOC) shall implement formal triage procedures to evaluate, investigate, and escalate alerts according to established response timelines.

**3.6 Incident Escalation**

All verified security events that are classified as potential incidents must be escalated to the Incident Response Team in accordance with the **Incident Response Plan (RES-PROC-001)**. Escalation criteria include events that may impact user data confidentiality, platform availability, regulatory compliance, or business operations beyond normal operational parameters.

### 5. Definitions

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** A security management system that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware, enabling centralized log management and correlation of security events.

**EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** A cybersecurity technology that monitors endpoint devices to detect and investigate suspicious activities, providing capabilities for threat hunting, incident response, and remediation.

**UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):** A security analytics technology that uses machine learning and statistical analysis to detect anomalous user and entity behaviors that may indicate security threats or policy violations.

**Log Correlation:** The process of analyzing log data from multiple sources to identify patterns, relationships, and security events that may not be apparent when examining individual log entries in isolation.
