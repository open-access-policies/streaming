### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for the responsible development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems within the Company's video streaming platform, ensuring AI technologies are used ethically, securely, and in compliance with applicable regulations while maintaining user trust and platform integrity.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all AI and machine learning systems used by the Company, including content recommendation algorithms, content moderation systems, user behavior analysis tools, and any AI-powered features accessible to users. It covers all employees, contractors, and third parties involved in AI development, deployment, or operation.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 AI Governance and Oversight**

The Company shall maintain comprehensive governance for AI systems:
- AI Ethics Committee with diverse stakeholder representation
- Risk assessment requirements for all AI system deployments
- Regular audits of AI system performance and bias metrics
- Clear accountability and decision-making frameworks
- Integration with overall risk management and compliance programs

**3.2 Content Moderation AI Systems**

AI systems used for content moderation must meet enhanced requirements:
- Regular bias testing across demographic groups and content types
- Human review requirements for high-impact moderation decisions
- Transparency reporting on automated content actions
- User appeal mechanisms for AI-driven content decisions
- Compliance with EU Digital Services Act algorithmic accountability requirements
- Regular retraining to address emerging content threats and reduce false positives

**3.3 Recommendation Algorithm Governance**

Content recommendation systems require special oversight:
- Regular assessment of algorithmic amplification effects
- Bias testing to prevent discriminatory content promotion
- User control mechanisms for recommendation preferences
- Transparency regarding recommendation factors and data usage
- Protection against manipulation and coordinated inauthentic behavior
- Compliance with DSA requirements for recommender system transparency

**3.4 AI System Security**

All AI systems must implement robust security controls:
- Secure development lifecycle practices for AI/ML models
- Protection against adversarial attacks and model poisoning
- Secure model storage and version control
- Access controls for training data and model parameters
- Monitoring for unauthorized model access or extraction
- Regular security testing specific to AI/ML vulnerabilities

**3.5 Data Privacy and AI**

AI systems must comply with privacy requirements:
- Privacy-by-design principles in AI system development
- Data minimization for AI training and inference
- User consent mechanisms for AI-driven features
- Compliance with GDPR automated decision-making requirements
- COPPA compliance for AI systems affecting children
- Regular privacy impact assessments for AI deployments

**3.6 AI Transparency and Explainability**

AI systems must provide appropriate transparency:
- Documentation of AI system purpose, capabilities, and limitations
- Explainable AI techniques for high-impact decisions
- User notification when AI systems significantly affect their experience
- Public reporting on AI system performance and bias metrics
- Clear communication about AI capabilities and limitations to users

**3.7 Third-Party AI Services**

Use of external AI services requires additional oversight:
- Security and privacy assessments of AI service providers
- Contractual requirements for bias testing and transparency
- Data protection agreements covering AI training and inference data
- Regular monitoring of third-party AI service performance
- Contingency planning for AI service disruptions or terminations

**3.8 Prohibited AI Uses**

The following AI applications are prohibited:
- Discriminatory profiling based on protected characteristics
- Manipulation of user behavior for harmful purposes
- Surveillance systems that violate user privacy expectations
- AI systems that lack appropriate human oversight for high-risk decisions
- Deep fake or synthetic media creation without clear disclosure
