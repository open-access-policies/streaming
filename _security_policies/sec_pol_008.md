### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish a systematic approach for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across [Company Name]'s video streaming platform infrastructure, applications, and systems to maintain a strong security posture and protect against cyber threats.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all information systems, applications, network devices, and infrastructure components that support the video streaming platform, including production, staging, and development environments. It covers all employees, contractors, and third parties responsible for system maintenance, security, and vulnerability remediation.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Vulnerability Identification**

The Company shall maintain comprehensive vulnerability identification capabilities:
- Automated vulnerability scanning tools for all network-accessible systems
- Regular penetration testing by qualified security professionals
- Security code reviews and static application security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) for web applications
- Container and cloud infrastructure vulnerability assessments
- Threat intelligence integration to identify emerging vulnerabilities
- Internal and external vulnerability scans must be conducted at least quarterly and after any significant change in the network

**3.2 Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization**

All identified vulnerabilities must be assessed and prioritized:
- Risk-based prioritization considering exploitability, impact, and business criticality
- Enhanced priority for vulnerabilities affecting user data or platform availability
- Special consideration for vulnerabilities in content delivery systems
- Integration with threat intelligence to identify actively exploited vulnerabilities
- Regular reassessment of vulnerability priorities based on changing threat landscape

**3.3 Remediation Timelines**

Vulnerabilities must be remediated according to established timelines:

**Critical Vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 4] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 72] hours
- Includes vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration

**High Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 24] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 7] days
- Includes privilege escalation and significant data exposure vulnerabilities

**Medium Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 72] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 30] days
- Includes information disclosure and authentication bypass vulnerabilities

**Low Vulnerabilities (CVSS 0.1-3.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 7] days
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 90] days
- Includes minor information leaks and configuration issues

**3.4 Platform-Specific Vulnerability Management**

Special attention to video streaming platform vulnerabilities:
- Content delivery network (CDN) security assessments
- Video encoding and streaming protocol vulnerabilities
- Mobile application security testing across multiple platforms
- Third-party player and plugin vulnerability monitoring
- API security testing for platform integrations
- User-generated content processing pipeline security reviews

**3.5 Remediation Tracking and Reporting**

Vulnerability remediation must be tracked and reported:
- Centralized vulnerability management system for tracking remediation status
- Regular reporting to executive leadership on vulnerability metrics
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for remediation timelines and effectiveness
- Integration with change management processes for vulnerability fixes
- Documentation of remediation decisions and risk acceptance rationales

**3.6 Emergency Response Procedures**

Procedures for handling critical vulnerabilities:
- 24/7 emergency response capability for critical vulnerabilities
- Pre-approved emergency change procedures for security patches
- Communication protocols for notifying stakeholders of critical vulnerabilities
- Coordination with incident response team for actively exploited vulnerabilities
- Business continuity considerations for emergency vulnerability remediation

**3.7 Third-Party and Vendor Vulnerability Management**

Management of vulnerabilities in third-party systems:
- Regular security assessments of vendor systems and applications
- Contractual requirements for timely vulnerability disclosure and remediation
- Monitoring of vendor security advisories and patch notifications
- Risk assessment for vendor systems that cannot be immediately patched
- Alternative mitigations when vendor patches are not available

**3.8 Vulnerability Disclosure Program**

The Company shall maintain a responsible disclosure program:
- Public vulnerability disclosure policy and reporting mechanisms
- Bug bounty program for crowd-sourced vulnerability identification
- Clear guidelines for security researchers reporting vulnerabilities
- Coordinated disclosure timelines and communication procedures
- Recognition and reward programs for valuable vulnerability reports

**3.9 Penetration Testing**

Internal and external penetration testing must be conducted at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification. Testing should cover the entire Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) perimeter and critical systems.

**3.10 Exception Handling and Compensating Controls**

In cases where immediate remediation of a vulnerability according to the defined timelines is not technically feasible without causing significant business disruption, a temporary compensating control (e.g., a Web Application Firewall rule) may be implemented. This exception requires formal approval and documentation via the Risk Acceptance Procedure (SEC-PROC-003) and must have a defined review date, not to exceed 90 days.

### 4. Standards Compliance

| **Policy Section** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.12.6.1 |
| **3.1, 3.9** | PCI DSS v4.0 | Req. 11.2, 11.3 |
| **3.2, 3.3** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | RS.MI-3 |
| **3.4** | SOC 2 Type II | CC7.1 |
| **3.5** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.16.1.6 |
| **3.6** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | RS.RP-1 |
| **3.8** | ISO/IEC 29147:2018 | Vulnerability Disclosure |

### 5. Definitions

**Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system, application, or network that could be exploited by a threat actor to compromise security.

**CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** A standardized system for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities.

**Penetration Testing:** Authorized simulated attacks against systems to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Security testing performed on application source code without executing the program.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Security testing performed on running applications to identify vulnerabilities.

**Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A security vulnerability that is unknown to security vendors and for which no patch is available.

**Responsible Disclosure:** A process for reporting vulnerabilities that allows organizations time to fix issues before public disclosure.
