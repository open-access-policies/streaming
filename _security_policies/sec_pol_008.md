### 1. Objective

This policy establishes a systematic approach for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across [Company Name]'s video streaming platform infrastructure, applications, and systems. The framework ensures continuous protection against cyber threats while maintaining operational excellence through proactive vulnerability management practices. This strategic approach enables rapid response to emerging security risks and maintains platform reliability for our global user base.

### 2. Scope

This policy encompasses all information systems, applications, network devices, and infrastructure components that support the video streaming platform, including production, staging, and development environments. Coverage extends to all employees, contractors, and third parties responsible for system maintenance, security, and vulnerability remediation. The policy framework applies to both cloud-based and on-premises infrastructure components, ensuring comprehensive protection across our entire technology ecosystem.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Vulnerability Identification**

The Company must maintain automated vulnerability scanning tools for all network-accessible systems. The Company must ensure regular penetration testing by qualified security professionals. The Company must conduct security code reviews and static application security testing (SAST). The Company must perform dynamic application security testing (DAST) for web applications. The Company must execute container and cloud infrastructure vulnerability assessments. The Company must integrate threat intelligence to identify emerging vulnerabilities. The Company must conduct internal and external vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after any significant change in the network.

**3.2 Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization**

All identified vulnerabilities must utilize risk-based prioritization considering exploitability, impact, and business criticality with enhanced priority for vulnerabilities affecting user data or platform availability, special consideration for vulnerabilities in content delivery systems, and integration with threat intelligence to identify actively exploited vulnerabilities including regular reassessment of vulnerability priorities based on changing threat landscape.

**3.3 Remediation Timelines**

Vulnerabilities must be remediated according to established timelines:

**Critical Vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 4] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 72] hours
- Includes vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration

**High Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 24] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 7] days
- Includes privilege escalation and significant data exposure vulnerabilities

**Medium Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 72] hours
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 30] days
- Includes information disclosure and authentication bypass vulnerabilities

**Low Vulnerabilities (CVSS 0.1-3.9):**
- Initial response: Within [Number, e.g., 7] days
- Remediation: Within [Number, e.g., 90] days
- Includes minor information leaks and configuration issues

**3.4 Platform-Specific Vulnerability Management**

The Company must conduct content delivery network (CDN) security assessments and address video encoding and streaming protocol vulnerabilities. The Company must perform mobile application security testing across multiple platforms and monitor third-party player and plugin vulnerabilities. The Company must execute API security testing for platform integrations and conduct user-generated content processing pipeline security reviews.

**3.5 Remediation Tracking and Reporting**

Vulnerability remediation must utilize a centralized vulnerability management system for tracking remediation status. The Company must provide regular reporting to executive leadership on vulnerability metrics and maintain key performance indicators (KPIs) for remediation timelines and effectiveness. The Company must ensure integration with change management processes for vulnerability fixes and maintain documentation of remediation decisions and risk acceptance rationales.

**3.6 Emergency Response Procedures**

The Company must maintain 24/7 emergency response capability for critical vulnerabilities and implement pre-approved emergency change procedures for security patches. The Company must establish communication protocols for notifying stakeholders of critical vulnerabilities and ensure coordination with incident response teams for actively exploited vulnerabilities. The Company must incorporate business continuity considerations for emergency vulnerability remediation.

**3.7 Third-Party and Vendor Vulnerability Management**

The Company must conduct regular security assessments of vendor systems and applications and establish contractual requirements for timely vulnerability disclosure and remediation. The Company must monitor vendor security advisories and patch notifications and perform risk assessments for vendor systems that cannot be immediately patched. The Company must implement alternative mitigations when vendor patches are not available.

**3.8 Vulnerability Disclosure Program**

The Company must maintain a public vulnerability disclosure policy and reporting mechanisms and operate a bug bounty program for crowd-sourced vulnerability identification. The Company must provide clear guidelines for security researchers reporting vulnerabilities and establish coordinated disclosure timelines and communication procedures. The Company must implement recognition and reward programs for valuable vulnerability reports.

**3.9 Penetration Testing**

Internal and external penetration testing must be conducted at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification. Testing should cover the entire Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) perimeter and critical systems.

**3.10 Exception Handling and Compensating Controls**

In cases where immediate remediation of a vulnerability according to the defined timelines is not technically feasible without causing significant business disruption, a temporary compensating control (e.g., a Web Application Firewall rule) may be implemented. This exception requires formal approval and documentation via the Risk Acceptance Procedure (SEC-PROC-003) and must have a defined review date, not to exceed 90 days.

### 5. Definitions

**Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system, application, or network that could be exploited by a threat actor to compromise security.

**CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** A standardized system for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities.

**Penetration Testing:** Authorized simulated attacks against systems to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Security testing performed on application source code without executing the program.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Security testing performed on running applications to identify vulnerabilities.

**Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A security vulnerability that is unknown to security vendors and for which no patch is available.
