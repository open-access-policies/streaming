### 1. Objective

This policy establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for password creation, management, and protection to safeguard access to [Company Name]'s video streaming platform, user accounts, and information systems. The policy provides robust protection from unauthorized access and credential-based attacks while ensuring secure authentication across all organizational systems and user touchpoints.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies comprehensively to all employees, contractors, and third parties who have access to Company systems, applications, or data resources. The scope encompasses all passwords used for authentication to corporate systems, administrative accounts, service accounts, and any systems involved in video streaming operations and user data processing across all operational environments.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Password Complexity Requirements**

All passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements. User account passwords require a minimum length of [Number, e.g., 12] characters, while privileged and administrative accounts require a minimum of [Number, e.g., 16] characters. All passwords must contain a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters and must not contain dictionary words, personal information, or predictable patterns. Additionally, passwords must not be reused until [Number, e.g., 12] subsequent unique passwords have been used.

**3.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- The Company **must** mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged and administrative accounts.
- MFA **must** be required for accessing any system that processes user data or payment information.
- All remote access to corporate networks and systems **must** be protected by MFA.
- Access to content management and content moderation systems **must** require MFA.
- All developer access to production environments **must** be authenticated using MFA.

**3.3 Password Management**

Users must implement comprehensive password management practices to ensure security. Approved password managers must be used for storing and generating passwords to maintain unique, complex credentials across all systems. Passwords must never be shared or written down in unsecured locations, and users must change passwords immediately if compromise is suspected. Any suspected password compromises must be reported to the security team promptly for immediate response and remediation.

**3.4 Service Account Passwords**

Service accounts must maintain the highest level of password security through automated management systems. Randomly generated passwords of at least [Number, e.g., 32] characters must be used for all service accounts to ensure maximum entropy and security. These passwords must be rotated at least every [Number, e.g., 90] days or immediately when personnel with access leave the organization. All service account credentials must be stored in approved credential management systems with comprehensive access logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized usage attempts.

**3.5 User Account Password Management**

- Platform user accounts **must** enforce minimum 8-character passwords with complexity requirements.
- Account lockout **must** be implemented after [Number, e.g., 5] failed authentication attempts.
- Secure password reset mechanisms **must** be provided to users for account recovery.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) **must** be encouraged for all user accounts.
- Breach monitoring and forced password resets **must** be implemented when security incidents are detected.

**3.6 Password Storage and Transmission**

Passwords must:
- Never be transmitted or stored in clear text
- Be hashed using approved cryptographic algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2)
- Include appropriate salt values to prevent rainbow table attacks
- Be protected during transmission using TLS 1.3 or higher

### 5. Definitions

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** An authentication method that requires two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource.

**Privileged Account:** An account with elevated permissions that can access sensitive systems, data, or perform administrative functions.

**Service Account:** A non-human account used by applications, services, or automated processes to authenticate and access systems.

**Password Manager:** An approved software application designed to store and manage passwords securely.

**Credential Management System:** A centralized system for securely storing, managing, and auditing access credentials.

### 6. Responsibilities
