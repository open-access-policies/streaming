### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for encryption technologies and cryptographic key management to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data processed, transmitted, and stored by the video streaming platform, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all data encryption, cryptographic operations, and key management activities within the Company's video streaming platform. It covers data at rest, data in transit, user authentication, content protection, and all cryptographic keys used across all systems, applications, and geographic regions.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Encryption Standards and Algorithms**

All encryption implementations must use approved cryptographic standards:
- AES-256 for symmetric encryption of data at rest
- RSA-4096 or ECDSA P-384 for asymmetric encryption and digital signatures
- TLS 1.3 for all data transmission and API communications
- SHA-256 or SHA-3 for cryptographic hashing and integrity verification
- PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing with appropriate iteration counts
- Regular review and update of approved algorithms based on security research

**3.2 Data Encryption Requirements**

Encryption must be applied based on data classification and sensitivity:

**User Data Encryption:**
- All personally identifiable information (PII) encrypted at rest using AES-256
- User viewing history and preferences encrypted with field-level encryption
- Payment information tokenized and encrypted according to PCI DSS requirements
- User communications and messages end-to-end encrypted where feasible

**Content Protection:**
- Digital Rights Management (DRM) for premium and licensed content
- Content encryption during upload, processing, and storage
- Secure content delivery with encrypted streaming protocols
- Watermarking for content leak detection and prevention

**System and Infrastructure Encryption:**
- Full disk encryption for all servers and workstations
- Database encryption at rest with transparent data encryption (TDE)
- Backup encryption using approved algorithms and key management
- Log file encryption for security and audit logs

**3.3 Key Management Framework**

Cryptographic keys must be managed through comprehensive lifecycle procedures:
- Centralized key management system with hardware security modules (HSMs)
- Role-based access controls for key management operations
- Key generation using cryptographically secure random number generators
- Key escrow and recovery procedures for business continuity
- Regular key rotation schedules based on key type and risk assessment
- Secure key destruction and sanitization procedures

**3.4 Key Lifecycle Management**

All cryptographic keys must follow structured lifecycle management:

**Key Generation:**
- Use of certified random number generators and entropy sources
- Key ceremony procedures for master keys with multiple authorized participants
- Documentation of key parameters, purposes, and authorized usage

**Key Distribution:**
- Secure key distribution mechanisms using authenticated channels
- Key wrapping and protection during transmission
- Verification of key integrity upon receipt

**Key Storage:**
- Hardware security modules (HSMs) for master keys and high-value keys
- Encrypted key storage with access logging and monitoring
- Geographic distribution of key storage for disaster recovery

**Key Rotation:**
- Automated key rotation for operational keys (quarterly minimum)
- Manual rotation procedures for master keys (annually minimum)
- Emergency key rotation procedures for compromised keys

**Key Destruction:**
- Secure deletion and sanitization of retired keys
- Documentation of key destruction with audit trails
- Verification of complete key removal from all systems

**3.5 Platform-Specific Encryption Requirements**

Special encryption considerations for video streaming operations:

**Content Delivery Encryption:**
- HTTPS/TLS for all content delivery endpoints
- Progressive download encryption for mobile applications
- Adaptive bitrate streaming with encrypted segments
- CDN-level encryption and secure content caching

**Mobile Application Encryption:**
- Application-level encryption for locally stored content
- Secure communication protocols for API interactions
- Platform-specific encryption using iOS Keychain and Android Keystore
- Offline content encryption with time-limited access

**Analytics and Recommendation Data:**
- Anonymization and pseudonymization techniques for user analytics
- Differential privacy techniques for aggregate data analysis
- Encrypted machine learning model parameters and training data
- Secure multi-party computation for cross-platform analytics

**3.6 Regulatory Compliance**

Encryption implementations must meet regulatory requirements:
- GDPR encryption requirements for personal data protection
- CCPA encryption standards for consumer data protection
- Export control compliance for cryptographic technologies
- Regional encryption requirements for cross-border data transfers
- Law enforcement access procedures with appropriate legal protections
