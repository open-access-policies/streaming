parent: Operational Policies
order: 2
---

### 1. Objective

This policy establishes comprehensive security requirements for mobile devices used to access Company systems, data, and video streaming platform resources across all deployment scenarios. The policy covers both company-owned and personally-owned (BYOD) devices, ensuring appropriate protection while maintaining productivity and optimal user experience for all authorized users.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all mobile devices including smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices used by employees, contractors, and authorized third parties to access Company email, applications, data, or video streaming platform systems. It covers both company-provided devices and personal devices used for business purposes.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Device Enrollment and Management**

- All mobile devices accessing Company resources **must** be enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) systems.
- Mandatory MDM enrollment **must** be completed before accessing corporate email or applications.
- Device compliance verification **must** include operating system version and security patch validation.
- Remote management capabilities **must** be enabled for security configuration and policy enforcement.
- Automatic enrollment **must** be implemented for company-owned devices and voluntary enrollment provided for BYOD.
- Regular compliance scanning and remediation **must** be performed for non-compliant devices.

**3.2 Security Configuration Requirements**

Mobile devices must meet minimum security configuration standards:
- Device encryption enabled for all storage (internal and external)
- Screen lock with PIN, password, biometric, or pattern authentication
- Automatic screen lock timeout not exceeding [Number, e.g., 15] minutes
- Operating system updates applied within [Number, e.g., 30] days of release
- Anti-malware protection where available and appropriate
- Disable unnecessary services, connections, and applications

**3.3 Platform-Specific Requirements**

Special considerations for video streaming platform access:

**Content Creator Device Requirements:**
- Enhanced security for devices used for content creation and editing
- Secure storage and transmission of pre-release content
- Digital watermarking applications for content leak prevention
- Content access controls and time-limited viewing permissions
- Secure deletion capabilities for sensitive content

**Mobile Application Security:**
- Company video streaming applications installed only from official app stores
- Application-level authentication separate from device authentication
- Local content encryption for offline viewing capabilities
- Secure communication with backend services using certificate pinning
- Regular application updates with security patches

**[Trust & Safety Department/Team Name] Devices:**
- Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities for content moderation activities
- Secure access to content moderation tools and workflows
- Protected storage for content review decisions and documentation
- Multi-factor authentication for all trust and safety applications

**3.4 Data Protection and Privacy**

Mobile device data handling must protect both corporate and personal information:
- Containerization separating corporate and personal data on BYOD devices
- Corporate data encryption with separate encryption keys
- Remote wipe capabilities for corporate data only on BYOD devices
- Privacy protection for personal data and applications on BYOD devices
- Data loss prevention (DLP) controls for corporate data
- Backup and recovery procedures for corporate data

**3.5 Network and Communication Security**

Mobile device network access must be secured:
- VPN connectivity required for accessing internal Company resources
- Prohibition of connecting to unsecured or public Wi-Fi for business activities
- Bluetooth security configuration and pairing restrictions
- SMS and voice communication security for business-related communications
- Email encryption and secure messaging applications for sensitive communications

**3.6 Application Management**

Mobile applications must be managed and controlled:
- Approved application whitelist for corporate devices
- Application vetting and security assessment for business-critical applications
- Prohibition of jailbreaking or rooting devices accessing corporate resources
- Application sandboxing and isolation for corporate applications
- Regular application security updates and patch management

**3.7 Incident Response and Compliance**

Mobile device security incidents must be properly managed:
- Immediate reporting requirements for lost, stolen, or compromised devices
- Remote lock and wipe capabilities for emergency response
- Forensic preservation capabilities for security investigations
- Compliance monitoring and reporting for policy violations
- Regular security awareness training for mobile device users
