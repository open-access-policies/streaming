### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the detailed steps for responding to security incidents affecting the video streaming platform, ensuring rapid detection, containment, eradication, and recovery while maintaining appropriate communication and documentation throughout the incident lifecycle.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all security incidents affecting video streaming platform services, user data, or business operations. It covers incident detection, initial response, investigation, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities for all incident severity levels.

### 3. Overview

This procedure provides a structured approach to incident response that minimizes impact, preserves evidence, and ensures rapid restoration of normal operations. The process emphasizes rapid response for platform availability while maintaining thorough investigation and documentation capabilities.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **1** | **[Security Operations Role]** | Detect potential incident through automated monitoring, user reports, or threat intelligence and perform initial triage assessment. |
| **2** | **[Security Operations Role]** | Document incident details in incident management system including time, source, initial indicators, and preliminary severity assessment. |
| **3** | **[Security Operations Role]** | Validate incident classification and severity level, escalate to Incident Response Manager for P1/P2 incidents within 15 minutes. |
| **4** | **Incident Response Manager** | Activate incident response team based on incident type and severity, assign roles, and establish incident command center. |
| **5** | **Communications Lead** | Notify executive leadership within 1 hour for P1/P2 incidents and prepare initial internal communication to stakeholders. |
| **6** | **Technical Lead** | Assess immediate containment options, implement emergency containment measures to prevent further damage or data loss. |
| **7** | **Forensics Analyst** | Preserve evidence including system logs, network captures, and memory dumps before implementing containment measures. |
| **8** | **Technical Teams** | Execute detailed incident analysis including root cause investigation, impact assessment, and threat actor identification. |
| **9** | **Legal Counsel** | Assess legal and regulatory notification requirements, coordinate with law enforcement if required, and provide legal guidance. |
| **10** | **Technical Lead** | Implement eradication measures including threat removal, vulnerability patching, and security control strengthening. |
| **11** | **Operations Team** | Execute recovery procedures including system restoration, data recovery, and service availability verification with monitoring. |
| **12** | **Communications Lead** | Provide incident updates to stakeholders, users, and regulators as required, maintaining transparency and compliance obligations. |
| **13** | **Incident Response Manager** | Conduct incident closure review, validate all objectives met, and transition to post-incident review process. |
| **14** | **Quality Assurance** | Verify complete system functionality, performance benchmarks, and security posture before declaring full operational status. |

### 5. Standards Compliance

| **Procedure Step(s)** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **1-3** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.16.1.2 |
| **4-6** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | RS.RP-1 |
| **7** | SOC 2 Type II | CC7.4 |
| **9** | GDPR | Art. 33 |
| **12** | EU Digital Services Act | Art. 24 |

### 6. Artifact(s)

A comprehensive incident response record containing timeline of all actions, evidence collected, containment and eradication measures implemented, recovery procedures executed, stakeholder communications, and lessons learned stored in the incident management system with appropriate access controls and retention.

### 7. Definitions

**Incident Command Center:** A physical or virtual location where incident response team members coordinate response activities.

**Containment:** Actions taken to prevent an incident from spreading or causing additional damage to systems or data.

**Eradication:** The process of removing threats, vulnerabilities, and indicators of compromise from affected systems.

**Recovery:** The process of restoring systems and services to normal operation with appropriate monitoring and validation.

**Chain of Custody:** The chronological documentation of evidence handling to ensure integrity for potential legal proceedings.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Technical artifacts that suggest malicious activity or security incidents.

### 8. Responsibilities

| **Role** | **Responsibility** |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| **Incident Response Manager** | Lead overall incident response, coordinate team activities, make strategic decisions, and manage stakeholder communication. |
| **[Security Operations Role]s** | Monitor for incidents 24/7, perform initial triage, execute containment measures, and provide continuous threat analysis. |
| **Technical Leads** | Provide specialized technical expertise, lead system analysis and recovery, and implement security improvements. |
| **Forensics Analyst** | Preserve and analyze digital evidence, support legal investigations, and provide technical findings for legal proceedings. |
| **Communications Lead** | Manage all incident communications, coordinate with media relations, and ensure consistent messaging across stakeholders. |
| **Legal Counsel** | Provide legal guidance, manage regulatory notifications, coordinate with law enforcement, and oversee compliance obligations. |
