### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the systematic approach for testing business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to ensure video streaming platform services can be restored effectively during actual disasters and that recovery procedures meet established recovery time and recovery point objectives.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all business continuity and disaster recovery testing activities for critical video streaming platform services, infrastructure components, and business processes. It covers testing methodologies, scheduling, execution, and validation across all geographic regions and system tiers.

### 3. Overview

This procedure ensures regular validation of BCDR capabilities through structured testing that progresses from basic component tests to full-scale disaster simulations. The process validates recovery procedures, identifies gaps, and ensures teams are prepared for actual disaster scenarios affecting platform availability.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **1** | **BCDR Manager** | Develop annual BCDR testing schedule covering all critical systems with quarterly major tests and monthly component tests. |
| **2** | **Technical Teams** | Review and update BCDR procedures based on system changes, infrastructure updates, and previous test findings. |
| **3** | **Test Coordinator** | Plan specific test scenario including scope, objectives, success criteria, participant roles, and rollback procedures. |
| **4** | **Operations Team** | Prepare test environment ensuring all monitoring tools, communication systems, and recovery resources are available and functional. |
| **5** | **BCDR Manager** | Conduct pre-test briefing with all participants covering test objectives, procedures, roles, responsibilities, and safety measures. |
| **6** | **Test Coordinator** | Execute test scenario following documented procedures while monitoring system performance, recovery metrics, and team coordination. |
| **7** | **Technical Teams** | Perform system recovery procedures including failover activation, data restoration, and service validation following BCDR documentation. |
| **8** | **Operations Team** | Monitor recovery progress against RTO/RPO targets, document any deviations, and validate system functionality post-recovery. |
| **9** | **Communications Team** | Test incident communication procedures including stakeholder notifications, status updates, and external communication protocols. |
| **10** | **Quality Assurance** | Validate complete system functionality, performance benchmarks, data integrity, and user experience following recovery completion. |
| **11** | **Test Coordinator** | Document test results including successes, failures, lessons learned, and recommendations for procedure improvements. |
| **12** | **BCDR Manager** | Conduct post-test debrief with all participants to review performance, identify improvement opportunities, and plan corrective actions. |
| **13** | **Technical Teams** | Implement identified improvements to BCDR procedures, update documentation, and enhance recovery capabilities based on test findings. |
| **14** | **BCDR Manager** | Update BCDR test schedule and procedures based on lessons learned and prepare for next scheduled testing cycle. |

### 5. Standards Compliance

| **Procedure Step(s)** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **1-2** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.17.1.3 |
| **6-8** | SOC 2 Type II | CC7.3 |
| **10** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | RC.RP-1 |
| **11-13** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.17.1.3 |

### 6. Artifact(s)

A comprehensive BCDR test report containing test objectives, procedures executed, performance metrics against RTO/RPO targets, lessons learned, identified improvements, and updated procedures stored in the business continuity management system with executive review and approval documentation.

### 7. Definitions

**Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR):** Combined capabilities to maintain operations during disruptions and recover from disasters.

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Maximum acceptable time to restore a system or process after a disruption.

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time during a disaster.

**Failover:** The automatic or manual switching to backup systems when primary systems fail.

**Hot Site:** A fully equipped backup facility that can immediately take over operations during a disaster.

**Cold Site:** A backup facility with basic infrastructure that requires setup time before operations can begin.

**Tabletop Exercise:** A discussion-based exercise where participants walk through scenarios without actually executing procedures.

### 8. Responsibilities

| **Role** | **Responsibility** |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| **BCDR Manager** | Plan and coordinate all BCDR testing activities, ensure comprehensive test coverage, and track improvement implementation. |
| **Test Coordinator** | Execute specific BCDR tests, document results accurately, and facilitate post-test analysis and improvement planning. |
| **Technical Teams** | Execute technical recovery procedures, validate system functionality, and implement technical improvements identified during testing. |
| **Operations Team** | Monitor system performance during tests, coordinate recovery activities, and ensure operational readiness for actual disasters. |
| **Quality Assurance** | Validate system functionality and performance following recovery, ensure testing meets quality standards, and verify improvement effectiveness. |
| **Executive Leadership** | Review test results, approve improvement investments, and ensure organizational commitment to BCDR preparedness. |
