### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for managing changes to the video streaming platform's information systems, applications, and infrastructure to ensure changes are properly authorized, tested, and implemented without compromising security, availability, or user experience.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all changes to production systems, applications, network infrastructure, security controls, and platform configurations that support video streaming services. It covers planned changes, emergency changes, and standard changes across all environments and geographic regions.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Change Management Framework**

All changes must follow a structured change management process:
- Formal change request documentation and approval
- Risk assessment and impact analysis for all changes
- Testing and validation in non-production environments
- Rollback procedures and contingency planning
- Post-implementation review and documentation
- Integration with incident management and problem management

**3.2 Change Classification**

Changes are classified based on risk and urgency:

**Standard Changes:**
- Pre-approved, low-risk changes with documented procedures
- Routine maintenance, patches, and configuration updates
- Automated deployment through approved pipelines
- Minimal business impact and well-understood procedures
- Changes deployed via a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that includes mandatory security scans (SAST, SCA) and successful integration tests are considered pre-approved Standard Changes and do not require manual review by the [Change Governance Body Name]

**Normal Changes:**
- Changes requiring formal review and approval
- New feature deployments and system updates
- Infrastructure modifications and capacity changes
- Changes affecting multiple systems or user-facing services

**Emergency Changes:**
- Urgent changes required to resolve critical incidents
- Security patches for actively exploited vulnerabilities
- Changes needed to restore service availability
- Expedited approval process with post-implementation review

**3.3 Platform-Specific Change Requirements**

Special considerations for video streaming platform changes:

**Content Delivery Changes:**
- Geographic rollout strategies for global content delivery
- CDN configuration changes with traffic impact assessment
- Video encoding and transcoding pipeline modifications
- Content caching and storage system updates

**Algorithm Updates:**
- A/B testing requirements for recommendation algorithm changes
- Bias testing and fairness assessment for algorithm modifications
- User impact analysis for content moderation algorithm updates
- Gradual rollout procedures for algorithm deployments

**Mobile Application Changes:**
- App store approval process coordination
- Feature flag management for gradual feature rollouts
- Backward compatibility testing with older app versions
- Regional deployment strategies for different markets

**3.4 Change Authorization**

Change approval requirements vary by change type and impact:
- Technical approval from system owners and architecture teams
- Security approval for changes affecting security controls
- Business approval for changes affecting user experience
- Executive approval for high-risk or high-impact changes
- Automated approval for standard changes meeting pre-defined criteria

**3.5 Testing and Validation**

All changes must undergo appropriate testing:
- Unit testing and integration testing in development environments
- Security testing including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Performance testing to ensure scalability and user experience
- User acceptance testing for feature changes
- Regression testing to ensure existing functionality is preserved

**3.6 Deployment and Implementation**

Change deployment must follow controlled procedures:
- Scheduled maintenance windows for user-impacting changes
- Blue-green or canary deployment strategies for production changes
- Real-time monitoring during change implementation
- Immediate rollback capability for all changes
- Communication to stakeholders regarding change status

**3.7 Documentation and Audit Trail**

All changes must be fully documented:
- Change requests with business justification and technical details
- Approval records and authorization documentation
- Testing results and validation evidence
- Implementation logs and deployment records
- Post-implementation review and lessons learned

### 4. Standards Compliance

| **Policy Section** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.12.1.2 |
| **3.2, 3.4** | SOC 2 Type II | CC8.1 |
| **3.5** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | PR.IP-2 |
| **3.6** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.14.2.2 |
| **3.7** | SOC 2 Type II | CC3.1 |

### 5. Definitions

**Change:** Any addition, modification, or removal of anything that could affect IT services and systems.

**[Change Governance Body Name]:** A group of stakeholders responsible for reviewing and authorizing normal and emergency changes.

**Rollback:** The process of returning a system to its previous state following an unsuccessful change.

**Blue-Green Deployment:** A deployment strategy that reduces downtime by running two identical production environments.

**Canary Deployment:** A deployment strategy that gradually rolls out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.

**Feature Flag:** A software development technique that allows features to be enabled or disabled without deploying new code.

**Maintenance Window:** A scheduled period when changes can be made to production systems with minimal user impact.

### 6. Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Change Advisory Board** | Review and approve normal changes, assess change risks, and ensure proper change management processes. |
| **Change Initiators** | Submit complete change requests, provide business justification, and coordinate change implementation. |
| **System Owners** | Review changes affecting their systems, participate in testing, and approve technical implementations. |
| **Operations Team** | Implement approved changes, monitor system performance, and execute rollback procedures when necessary. |
| **[Security Department/Team Name]** | Review security implications of changes, approve security-related changes, and monitor for security impacts. |
| **Quality Assurance** | Conduct testing and validation of changes, verify functionality, and ensure quality standards are met. |
