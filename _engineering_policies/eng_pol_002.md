### 1. Objective

This policy establishes comprehensive requirements for managing changes to the video streaming platform's information systems, applications, and infrastructure. The policy ensures that all changes are properly authorized, thoroughly tested, and implemented systematically without compromising security, availability, or user experience across the platform's operations.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies comprehensively to all changes affecting production systems, applications, network infrastructure, security controls, and platform configurations that support video streaming services. The policy governs planned changes, emergency changes, and standard changes across all environments and geographic regions where the company operates its services.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Change Management Framework**

- All changes **must** follow a structured change management process with documented procedures.
- Formal change request documentation and approval **must** be obtained before implementing any changes.
- Risk assessment and impact analysis **must** be conducted for all changes regardless of scope or complexity.
- Testing and validation **must** be performed in non-production environments before production deployment.
- Rollback procedures and contingency planning **must** be established for all changes.
- Post-implementation review and documentation **must** be completed for all changes.
- Change management **must** be integrated with incident management and problem management processes.

**3.2 Change Classification**

Changes are classified based on risk and urgency:

**Standard Changes:**

Standard changes must be pre-approved, low-risk modifications with established documented procedures. These include routine maintenance activities, security patches, and configuration updates that follow well-understood processes. Automated deployments through approved pipelines are permitted for standard changes, provided they have minimal business impact and utilize well-tested procedures. Changes deployed via fully automated CI/CD pipelines that include mandatory security scans (SAST, SCA) and successful integration tests are considered pre-approved Standard Changes and do not require manual review by the [Change Governance Body Name].

**Normal Changes:**

Normal changes require formal review and approval through established governance processes. These changes include new feature deployments and significant system updates that may impact operations. Infrastructure modifications and capacity changes fall into this category, as do changes affecting multiple systems or user-facing services that require coordinated implementation and oversight.

**Emergency Changes:**

Emergency changes are urgent modifications required to resolve critical incidents or address immediate security threats. These include security patches for actively exploited vulnerabilities and changes needed to restore service availability during outages. Emergency changes must follow an expedited approval process while maintaining appropriate controls, with mandatory post-implementation review to ensure proper documentation and learning capture.

**3.3 Platform-Specific Change Requirements**

Special considerations for video streaming platform changes:

**Content Delivery Changes:**

Content delivery modifications require careful consideration of global impact and user experience. Geographic rollout strategies must be implemented for global content delivery network changes to ensure smooth transitions across different regions. CDN configuration changes must include comprehensive traffic impact assessments to prevent service disruptions. Video encoding and transcoding pipeline modifications must be thoroughly tested to maintain content quality and delivery performance. Content caching and storage system updates must be coordinated to ensure continuous availability and optimal performance across all geographic locations.

**Algorithm Updates:**

Algorithm changes require specialized testing and validation procedures to ensure fairness and effectiveness. A/B testing requirements must be fulfilled for all recommendation algorithm changes to validate performance and user impact. Bias testing and fairness assessments must be conducted for algorithm modifications to prevent discriminatory outcomes. User impact analysis must be performed for content moderation algorithm updates to ensure proper content governance. Gradual rollout procedures must be implemented for algorithm deployments to monitor performance and user response before full implementation.

**Mobile Application Changes:**

Mobile application modifications require coordination with external app store approval processes and careful consideration of user device diversity. App store approval process coordination must be managed to ensure timely deployment and compliance with platform requirements. Feature flag management must be implemented for gradual feature rollouts to control user exposure and gather feedback. Backward compatibility testing must be conducted with older app versions to ensure continued functionality for users who have not updated. Regional deployment strategies must be developed for different markets to account for varying user preferences and regulatory requirements.

**3.4 Change Authorization**

- Technical approval **must** be obtained from system owners and architecture teams for all changes affecting system functionality.
- Security approval **must** be secured for any changes affecting security controls or potentially impacting security posture.
- Business approval **must** be obtained for changes affecting user experience or business operations.
- Executive approval **must** be required for high-risk or high-impact changes that could significantly affect operations.
- Automated approval **must** be configured only for standard changes that meet pre-defined criteria and risk thresholds.

**3.5 Testing and Validation**

- All changes **must** undergo unit testing and integration testing in dedicated development environments.
- Security testing **must** be performed including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing for security-relevant changes.
- Performance testing **must** be conducted to ensure scalability and optimal user experience.
- User acceptance testing **must** be completed for all feature changes that impact user functionality.
- Regression testing **must** be performed to ensure existing functionality is preserved and not adversely affected.

**3.6 Deployment and Implementation**

- Scheduled maintenance windows **must** be established for user-impacting changes to minimize disruption.
- Blue-green or canary deployment strategies **must** be utilized for production changes to ensure safe rollouts.
- Real-time monitoring **must** be implemented during change implementation to detect issues immediately.
- Immediate rollback capability **must** be available and tested for all changes before deployment.
- Communication **must** be provided to stakeholders regarding change status and any potential impacts.

**3.7 Documentation and Audit Trail**

- All changes **must** be fully documented with comprehensive change requests including business justification and technical details.
- Approval records and authorization documentation **must** be maintained for all implemented changes.
- Testing results and validation evidence **must** be preserved to demonstrate proper verification procedures.
- Implementation logs and deployment records **must** be captured and stored for audit and troubleshooting purposes.
- Post-implementation review and lessons learned **must** be documented to improve future change management processes.

### 4. Standards Compliance

| **Policy Section** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.12.1.2 |

### 5. Definitions

**Change:** Any addition, modification, or removal of anything that could affect IT services and systems.

**[Change Governance Body Name]:** A group of stakeholders responsible for reviewing and authorizing normal and emergency changes.

**Rollback:** The process of returning a system to its previous state following an unsuccessful change.
