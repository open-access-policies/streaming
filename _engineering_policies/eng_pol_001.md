title: "Secure Software Development Policy (ENG-POL-001)"
order: 1
---

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for secure software development practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure that video streaming platform applications, services, and systems are designed, developed, and deployed with appropriate security controls and privacy protections.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all software development activities for the video streaming platform, including web applications, mobile applications, APIs, microservices, recommendation algorithms, and content processing systems. It covers all development teams, contractors, and third parties involved in software development for the Company.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Secure Development Lifecycle**

All software development must follow a secure SDLC that integrates security throughout all phases:
- Security requirements definition during project planning
- Threat modeling and security architecture review during design
- Secure coding practices during development
- Security testing throughout development and before deployment
- Security validation during deployment and operation
- Regular security updates and maintenance

**3.2 Privacy by Design**

All software development must implement privacy by design principles:
- Data minimization in system design and data collection
- Purpose limitation ensuring data is used only for stated purposes
- Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) for new features processing user data
- User consent mechanisms integrated into application workflows
- Data subject rights implementation (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
- Privacy-preserving technologies where applicable (encryption, anonymization)

**3.3 Secure Coding Standards**

Development teams must follow established secure coding practices:
- Use of approved programming languages and frameworks
- Input validation and output encoding for all user inputs
- Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Secure session management and token handling
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Secure API design and implementation
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

**3.4 Code Review and Testing**

All code must undergo comprehensive security review and testing:
- Mandatory peer code reviews with security focus
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated into build pipelines
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for web applications
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) where applicable
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for third-party dependencies
- Manual security testing for critical components

**3.5 Platform-Specific Security Requirements**

Special requirements for video streaming platform development:

**Content Processing Systems:**
- Secure handling of user-generated content uploads
- Malware scanning for all uploaded content
- Content encoding and transcoding security
- Digital rights management (DRM) integration
- Content delivery optimization with security controls

**Recommendation Algorithms:**
- Bias testing and fairness assessments
- Algorithm transparency and explainability features
- Protection against manipulation and gaming
- User control mechanisms for recommendation preferences
- Privacy-preserving recommendation techniques

**Mobile Applications:**
- Platform-specific security guidelines (iOS/Android)
- Secure communication with backend services
- Local data encryption and secure storage
- App store security requirements compliance
- Mobile device security features integration

**3.6 Third-Party Component Management**

Use of third-party libraries and components must be controlled:
- Approved software component repositories and registries
- Vulnerability scanning of all third-party dependencies
- License compliance verification for all components
- Regular updates and patching of third-party components
- Documentation of all external dependencies

**3.7 Development Environment Security**

Development environments must be properly secured:
- Separate development, staging, and production environments
- Access controls and authentication for development systems
- Secure configuration management and version control
- Protection of development credentials and API keys
- Regular security updates for development tools and systems

### 5. Definitions

**Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** A framework that integrates security activities into every phase of software development.

**Privacy by Design:** An approach that embeds privacy considerations into the design and architecture of systems and business practices.

**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA):** A process to identify and mitigate privacy risks in new or modified systems and processes.

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Automated testing of source code to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the program.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Automated testing of running applications to identify security vulnerabilities.

**Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Analysis of third-party and open source components to identify security and compliance issues.

**Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Technologies used to protect copyrighted digital content from unauthorized access and distribution.
