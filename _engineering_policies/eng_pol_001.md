- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) **must** be implemented where technically applicable and feasible.
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) **must** be conducted for all third-party dependencies prior to integration.
- Manual security testing **must** be performed for all critical system components and high-risk functionalities.

**3.5 Platform-Specific Security Requirements**

Special requirements for video streaming platform development:

**Content Processing Systems:**

All content processing systems must implement comprehensive security controls for user-generated content. Secure handling protocols must be established for all user-generated content uploads, including mandatory malware scanning for all uploaded content before processing. Content encoding and transcoding operations must include security controls to prevent exploitation, and digital rights management (DRM) integration must be implemented to protect intellectual property. Content delivery optimization must incorporate security controls to ensure safe and efficient distribution.

**Recommendation Algorithms:**

All recommendation algorithms must undergo comprehensive testing and validation to ensure fairness and prevent bias. Bias testing and fairness assessments must be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate discriminatory outcomes. Algorithm transparency and explainability features must be implemented to provide users with insight into recommendation logic. Protection mechanisms must be established to prevent manipulation and gaming of recommendation systems. User control mechanisms must be provided for recommendation preferences, and privacy-preserving recommendation techniques must be implemented to protect user data while maintaining service quality.

**Mobile Applications:**

- Mobile applications **must** comply with platform-specific security guidelines for both iOS and Android platforms.
- All mobile applications **must** implement secure communication protocols with backend services.
- Local data encryption and secure storage **must** be implemented for all sensitive information stored on mobile devices.
- App store security requirements **must** be met for all mobile application releases.
- Mobile device security features **must** be integrated where available to enhance application security.

**3.6 Third-Party Component Management**

- All third-party libraries and components **must** be sourced from approved software component repositories and registries.
- Vulnerability scanning **must** be performed on all third-party dependencies before integration and regularly thereafter.
- License compliance verification **must** be conducted for all components to ensure legal compliance.
- Regular updates and patching **must** be applied to all third-party components to address security vulnerabilities.
- Documentation **must** be maintained for all external dependencies including version information and security status.

**3.7 Development Environment Security**

Development environments must be properly secured through comprehensive controls and procedures. Separate development, staging, and production environments must be maintained to prevent cross-contamination of code and data. Access controls and authentication mechanisms must be implemented for all development systems to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive resources. Secure configuration management and version control systems must be used to track and protect code changes. Protection of development credentials and API keys must be implemented through secure storage and access management practices, and regular security updates must be applied to all development tools and systems.

**3.8 Payment Application Security (PCI DSS Requirements)**

All software development related to payment applications or systems within the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) must adhere to PCI DSS secure software development requirements. Developers working on payment applications must receive annual training on secure coding techniques and emerging threats related to payment security to maintain current knowledge and skills. Changes to bespoke and custom software, especially payment applications, must strictly follow the Change Control Policy (ENG-POL-002) to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities that could compromise payment data security.
