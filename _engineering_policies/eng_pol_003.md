### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish security requirements for the design, implementation, and operation of infrastructure supporting the video streaming platform to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of services while protecting against cyber threats and maintaining regulatory compliance.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all infrastructure components supporting video streaming services, including cloud environments, on-premises data centers, content delivery networks, network equipment, servers, storage systems, and supporting infrastructure across all geographic regions where the Company operates.

### 3. Policy

**3.1 Infrastructure Security Architecture**

Infrastructure must be designed and implemented with security controls:
- Defense-in-depth security architecture with multiple security layers
- Network segmentation and micro-segmentation for service isolation
- Zero-trust architecture principles for all network communications
- Secure-by-default configurations for all infrastructure components
- Regular security architecture reviews and threat modeling
- Integration with enterprise security monitoring and incident response

**3.2 Content Delivery Network (CDN) Security**

CDN infrastructure requires specialized security controls:
- Global distribution with regional failover capabilities
- DDoS protection and traffic anomaly detection
- Geographic content blocking and access controls
- Secure content caching with encryption at rest
- Origin shield protection to secure content sources
- Real-time threat intelligence integration for malicious traffic blocking
- Content integrity verification and tamper detection
- Bandwidth limiting and traffic shaping controls

**3.3 DDoS Mitigation**

Comprehensive DDoS protection must be implemented:
- Multi-layered DDoS protection (network, transport, and application layers)
- Volumetric attack mitigation with traffic scrubbing capabilities
- Protocol-based attack protection (SYN floods, UDP floods)
- Application-layer attack detection and mitigation
- Automated scaling and traffic rerouting during attacks
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for attack detection
- Regular DDoS simulation testing and response validation
- Coordination with ISPs and upstream providers for attack mitigation

**3.4 Data Sovereignty and Geographic Controls**

Infrastructure must comply with data sovereignty requirements:
- Data residency controls ensuring data remains within required geographic boundaries
- Regional data processing capabilities to meet local regulations
- Cross-border data transfer controls and legal basis documentation
- Localized content delivery respecting regional content restrictions
- Government data access request handling with appropriate legal protections
- Encryption key management with geographic controls
- Audit trails for all cross-border data movements

**3.5 Cloud Infrastructure Security**

Cloud environments must implement robust security controls:
- Identity and access management (IAM) with least privilege principles
- Multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
- Encryption in transit and at rest for all data
- Virtual private cloud (VPC) segmentation and security groups
- Continuous security monitoring and compliance scanning
- Automated security configuration management and drift detection
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

**3.6 Network Security**

Network infrastructure must be properly secured:
- Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) at network boundaries
- Network access control (NAC) for device authentication
- Secure remote access solutions with VPN or zero-trust access
- Network monitoring and traffic analysis for threat detection
- Wireless network security with enterprise authentication
- Regular network security assessments and penetration testing

**3.7 Server and Endpoint Security**

All servers and endpoints must maintain security standards:
- Hardened operating system configurations following security baselines
- Regular security patching and update management
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- Anti-malware protection with real-time scanning
- Host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Secure configuration management and compliance monitoring

**3.8 Storage Security**

Data storage systems require comprehensive protection:
- Encryption at rest for all stored data using approved algorithms
- Access controls and authentication for storage access
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
- Secure data disposal and sanitization procedures
- Storage monitoring and anomaly detection
- Data integrity verification and corruption detection

### 4. Standards Compliance

| **Policy Section** | **Standard/Framework** | **Control Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.13.1.1 |
| **3.2, 3.3** | SOC 2 Type II | CC6.7 |
| **3.4** | GDPR | Art. 44-49 |
| **3.5** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | PR.AC-4 |
| **3.6** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.13.1.3 |
| **3.7** | SOC 2 Type II | CC6.1 |
| **3.8** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 | A.10.1.1 |

### 5. Definitions

**Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A distributed network of servers that deliver content to users from geographically closer locations.

**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** An attack that uses multiple compromised systems to flood a target with traffic.

**Data Sovereignty:** Legal concept that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the country where it is collected or processed.

**Zero-Trust Architecture:** A security model that requires verification of every user and device before granting access to systems.

**Micro-segmentation:** A security technique that creates secure zones in data centers and cloud environments.

**Origin Shield:** A CDN feature that acts as an additional caching layer between edge servers and origin servers.

**Defense-in-Depth:** A layered security approach using multiple security controls to protect information assets.
