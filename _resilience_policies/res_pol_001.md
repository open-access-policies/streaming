### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all security incidents affecting the video streaming platform, including cyber attacks, data breaches, service outages, content security incidents, and privacy violations. It covers all employees, contractors, and third parties involved in incident detection, response, and recovery activities across all geographic regions.

- Widespread harmful content event requiring immediate intervention
- Major user data breach exposing >100,000 user records
- Complete failure of content delivery systems
- Active cyber attack causing significant service disruption
- Government emergency takedown demands requiring immediate action

**P2 (High) Incidents:**
- Regional platform outage affecting <50% of users
- Content moderation system failure allowing harmful content
- Limited data breach exposing <100,000 user records
- Significant performance degradation affecting user experience
- Successful cyber attack with contained impact
- Major algorithm bias incident affecting user recommendations

**P3 (Medium) Incidents:**
- Minor service disruptions with workarounds available
- Isolated content policy violations requiring review
- Privacy violations affecting individual users
- Unsuccessful cyber attack attempts with evidence of compromise
- Third-party service disruptions with limited platform impact
